## How it works

This project implements a **1D Systolic Array with 8 Processing Elements (PEs)** for multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, optimized for the Tiny Tapeout Sky130 process. The design follows a weight-stationary architecture with deterministic timing and no handshaking.

### Architecture Overview

The systolic array consists of:

- **8 Processing Elements (PEs)** arranged in a 1D chain
- **Systolic Controller** managing the FSM and control signals
- **4-bit signed integer arithmetic** for inputs (weights, biases, activations)
- **8-bit signed accumulators** with saturation logic to prevent overflow

### Processing Element (PE) Design

Each PE contains:
- A 4-bit weight register (stationary, loaded once)
- An 8-bit accumulator with saturation logic for summing results
- Multiply-accumulate logic: `accumulator = saturate(accumulator + (data_in × weight))`
- Pass-through data path for chaining PEs
- Saturation range: -128 to 127 (8-bit signed)

### Systolic Data Flow

1. **Weight Loading**: Weights are loaded sequentially into each PE (W0, W1, W2, W3, W4, W5, W6, W7)
2. **Bias Loading**: Biases are loaded sequentially into each PE's accumulator (B0, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7)
3. **Compute Phase**: Activation data flows through the chain:
   - PE0 receives data on cycle 0, computes for 8 cycles
   - PE1 receives data on cycle 1, computes for 8 cycles
   - PE2 receives data on cycle 2, computes for 8 cycles
   - PE3 receives data on cycle 3, computes for 8 cycles
   - PE4 receives data on cycle 4, computes for 8 cycles
   - PE5 receives data on cycle 5, computes for 8 cycles
   - PE6 receives data on cycle 6, computes for 8 cycles
   - PE7 receives data on cycle 7, computes for 8 cycles
4. **Drain Phase**: Results are read out sequentially from each PE

### FSM States

The controller implements a 5-state FSM:
- **IDLE**: Initial state, transitions immediately to LOAD_W
- **LOAD_W**: Load weights (8 cycles, one per PE)
- **LOAD_B**: Load biases (8 cycles, one per PE)
- **COMPUTE**: MAC operations (15 cycles to fill pipeline and compute)
- **DRAIN**: Output accumulated results (1+ cycles to read results)

### I/O Interface

- **ui_in[3:0]**: 4-bit data input (weights during LOAD_W, biases during LOAD_B, activations during COMPUTE)
- **ui_in[7:4]**: Unused
- **uo_out[7:0]**: 8-bit signed result during DRAIN
- **uio_out[7:0]**: Unused (all zeros)
- **uio_oe[7:0]**: Bidirectional enable (always output = 0xFF)

## How to test

### Automated Testing

The design includes a comprehensive cocotb test suite with 6 test cases:

1. **FSM State Transitions**: Verifies the state machine progresses correctly through all states
2. **Weight Loading**: Confirms weights are loaded into all 8 PEs
3. **Bias Loading**: Confirms biases are loaded into all 8 PE accumulators
4. **Signed Math Stress Test**: Tests signed arithmetic and corner cases (negative weights, overflow handling)
5. **Simple Computation**: Validates MAC operations with known inputs/outputs
6. **Full Cycle Test**: Tests multiple complete cycles of operation

Run the tests:
```bash
cd test
make clean
make
```

### Manual Testing Procedure

1. **Reset**: Assert `rst_n = 0` for at least 5 clock cycles, then release
2. **Load Weights**: The system automatically enters LOAD_W state. Apply 8 weight values on `ui_in[3:0]`, one per clock cycle (range: -8 to 7)
3. **Load Biases**: System transitions to LOAD_B. Apply 8 bias values on `ui_in[3:0]`, one per clock cycle (range: -8 to 7)
4. **Compute**: System transitions to COMPUTE. Apply 15 activation values on `ui_in[3:0]` (first 8 are processed, remaining 7 are for pipeline flushing)
5. **Drain**: System transitions to DRAIN. Read results from `uo_out[7:0]` (8-bit signed values with saturation, range: -128 to 127):
   - Cycle 0: PE0 result (sum of 8 MAC operations, saturated)
   - Cycle 1: PE1 result
   - Cycle 2: PE2 result
   - Cycle 3: PE3 result
   - Cycle 4: PE4 result
   - Cycle 5: PE5 result
   - Cycle 6: PE6 result
   - Cycle 7: PE7 result

### Example Test Case

Load: W = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2], B = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Compute: Data = [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (max 4-bit signed value)

Expected results (with saturation):
- PE0: 7×2 × 8 = 112
- PE1: 7×3 × 8 = 168 → **saturated to 127**
- PE2: 7×4 × 8 = 224 → **saturated to 127**
- PE3: 7×5 × 8 = 280 → **saturated to 127**
- PE4: 7×6 × 8 = 336 → **saturated to 127**
- PE5: 7×7 × 8 = 392 → **saturated to 127**
- PE6: 7×1 × 8 = 56
- PE7: 7×2 × 8 = 112

Note: Results exceeding ±127 will be saturated to the 8-bit signed range.

### Timing Constraints

- Clock frequency: 50 MHz (20ns period)
- Total cycle count per operation: 32 cycles (1 IDLE + 8 LOAD_W + 8 LOAD_B + 15 COMPUTE + 1 DRAIN minimum)
- Deterministic latency: No stalls or variable timing

## External hardware

No external hardware is required. The design is fully self-contained and can be tested using:
- Clock source (50 MHz recommended)
- 4-bit data input bus (ui_in[3:0])
- 8-bit result output bus (uo_out[7:0])
